Removes Eazfuscator.NET's evaluation period (aka trial limit) from protected assemblies â€” this allows it to run forever instead of expiring after seven days. [Download](https://github.com/Plot1337/EazTrialRemover/releases)

---

Usage: `EazTrialRemover.exe <assembly>` or drag-and-drop your protected assembly into `EazTrialRemover.exe`

NOTE: This works with Eaz.NET 2022.1; however, I am not sure if it will work in the future or in older versions. Works with Console and WinForms; should work for class-library and others, too. If there any any bugs, please open a issue.
